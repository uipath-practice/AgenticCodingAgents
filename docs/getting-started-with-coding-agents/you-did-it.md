# You did it!

Congratulations!

You've set up the UiPath CLI and skills, driven the platform from your terminal, and built and
published your first agent.

## What you built

You have a working coding-agent environment — the `uip` CLI authenticated to your tenant and the
UiPath skills loaded into your agent — and you've completed the full **build → publish → run** loop
once with a simple Claims Eligibility agent.

| Component | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UiPath CLI** (`uip`) | The interface your coding agent uses to talk to the platform |
| **UiPath skills** | Instruction packs that teach the agent when and how to use the CLI |
| **docsai** | Answers UiPath questions from the terminal, grounded in the docs |
| **Your first agent** | A low-code agent you generated, published, and ran in Studio Web |

## Next steps

### 1. Keep your setup current

During preview, skills and tools change often, probably daily. Refresh them now and then:

```bash
uip skills update --agent claude
uip tools update
```

### 2. Build a real agent

You've done the loop once with a simple agent. In the next exercise you'll build a richer one —
adding context and tools so the agent can reason over grounded data and take real actions.

## Keep iterating

**Ask for outcomes, not commands**

- Describe what you want done and let the agent choose the commands. Build the habit now.

**Trust the model**

- Don't over-optimize for tokens early. A stronger model often costs less because it makes fewer mistakes. Use it, and your intuition will follow.
